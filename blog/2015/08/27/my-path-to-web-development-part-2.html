 <h4>My Path to Web Development Part 2</h4>
  <article class="blog-p">
    <p>I was now tasked at figuring out what I wanted to do with my life and choosing a new major. 
I dabbled in Policy Studies during second semester but had to finally admit that I wasn’t really “political”. Sophomore year had now arrived and I still unsure of what path to take. Then one day I had an epiphany. When I wanted to become an interior designer I always imagined having my own design firm or opening a high-end furniture store. As a child I convinced my friends to help me set up a cookie stand at the entrance of our apartment complex. I launched ‘Rachael’s Cleaning Service’ in my home and posted my prices on the inside of our front door. Yes, I tried to charge my mom for doing chores. I had the blood of an entrepreneur! I immediately felt a rush of rejuvenation and basked in that moment of clarity. Wait, you can major in Entrepreneurship? Yep, and Syracuse had a top ranked program. Ironically, I purposely had not applied to any design specific universities in case I changed my mind (which I didn’t think I would). The stars seemed to have finally aligned, and I concluded that the even younger me wasn’t completely clueless.</p>

<p>I transferred into the School of Management and began my study of business. I wasn’t able to take Entrepreneurship classes until Wait, you can major in Entrepreneurship? Junior year because I had to complete core business classes first, but once I settled into my major I loved it! One of my favorite classes was Entrepreneurship &amp; Digital Marketing. This is when my interest it the web was re-born.  A lot had happened between 2003 and 2006. Facebook was launched in 2004 and Mark Zuckerberg was a Rockstar. That same year Google went public and Web 2.0 was THE buzzword. The web evolved into a space for user-generated content and websites became web applications. Everyone was trying to figure out how they could capitalize on it. I learned about SEO, Google Analytics and why it all mattered. I was very interested in this aspect marketing. I also finally revisited coding. I was a member of the campus gospel choir, BCCE, and ran for the position of Historian partly because the duties included maintaining the website. In order to prepare for the position I signed up an Intro to HTML class and attended workshops on Dreamweaver and FrontPage. Oh 2006. I remembered how awesome coding was I was grateful for the opportunity to receive formal training. I rocked as Historian and maintained the website for 2 years.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2007 with an interest in digital marking and starting a tech company. My first job was as an Admissions Rep (sales) for a computer training school. Sales was good experience but not exactly my forte so in 2008 I relocated from my hometown in Delaware to Washington, DC in search of new opportunities. In 2008 the recession hit and my main source of income was temp work. This was a hard time. I had to hustle to make ends meet but I believed that things would get better. They did and in 2009 I started work as Market Intelligence Analyst for a consulting firm supplying to research to help companies obtain government contracts. On the side I continued to learn more about web design and entrepreneurship. I taught myself how to build sites with WordPress and was always brainstorming business ideas. I continued my career in marketing and eventually moved back to Delaware and obtained a position an Analyst specializing in email marketing. By this time the web was changing again and the mobile revolution was in full effect. Mobile websites vs. responsive web design was a hot topic and I thought about how I could capitalize. There were new platforms being for creating for starting stand-alone mobile websites…</p>
