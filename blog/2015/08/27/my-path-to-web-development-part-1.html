 <h4>My Path to Web Development Part 1</h4>
  <article class="blog-p">
    <p>This is my story. It all started in 2003 during my Freshman year of college at Syracuse University. Although I had grown up with computers we didn’t own one in our home, so as a going away present my family came together and bought me my first computer. It was an HP Desktop that I named Connor.</p>

<p>Since I usually used computers at school or the library (nerd haha), I had no idea about and the budding world of social networking. The first network I discovered was BlackPlanet, a very popular online community for African Americans. It had been around since 1999 and was one of a handful of niche sites at the time such as AsianAvenue, MiGente and Friendster. But, in addition to meeting new people, you could customize your profile page with this coding language called HTML. I was hooked! There were some really nice pages and I wanted mine to have a fighting chance. I remember being obsessed with working on my page and hoping the glare from my monitor in my little box dorm didn’t disturb my sleeping roommate. I would be up all hours learning about tags, links and not understanding the purpose of CSS. The <font> tag was awesome! Oh 2003. Coincidently, that was the year MySpace launched, and I was suddenly in the know (yay)! MySpace customizations became a big thing, and I discovered that I really enjoyed coding. It was exciting to have an idea, figure out how to execute it and make it live for the word to see.</font></p>

<p>However, as I became more immersed into my studies coding took a back seat. Although I loved it, it just didn’t cross my mind as something I could do as a career. My dream was to become an interior designer, and I was enrolled in the School of Visual &amp; Performing Arts. I didn’t know of anyone who was a web designer or computer programmer and until my experience with coding on social networking sites, I’d never really given thought to how the web worked.</p>

<p>Then, after one semester of classes my world was turned upside-down. I decided that interior design was not for me. I enjoyed it as hobby but as a career I felt something was missing. I was lost; I wanted to be an interior designer since I was in the 6th grade. Yes, college is the time to explore your interests, let your intellectual curiosities run free, but at the time I remember hating that I didn’t know what direction to take. I worked hard in high school and received an academic Deans’ Scholarship. I wanted to study, graduate, get a great job and live happily ever after. That’s how it’s supposed to happen, right? Oh If I could only go back in time I would tell my younger self that the path to rewarding career is seldom linear. It ended up taking almost 9 years from that point to arrive at Web Development…. But I am getting ahead of myself so let’s get back to the story.</p>
